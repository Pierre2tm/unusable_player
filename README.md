# unusable_player
Unusable Player is a flutter music player based on just_audio package.
It's a portfolio project, it's not meant to be used in real life.
Its focuses on visuals instead of usability and performance, that's why the project is called "Unusable Player".
This project takes inspiration from Sulton Handaya's artwork:

# Caution
This project isn't representative of my actual coding standard.
If you take inspiration from this source code, keep a critical eye. Some parts of this project are better than others.
If I should restart this project today, I would:
- Use Bloc (and state_machine_bloc 😏) instead of GetX
- Use a feature-based project organization

Some animation parts are especially messy. Use at your own risk.
